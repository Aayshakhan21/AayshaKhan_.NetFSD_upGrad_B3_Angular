      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the
      presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects
      such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).

        CSS describes how elements should be
      rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among
      the core languages of the open web and is standardized across web browsers
      according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various
      parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the
      versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1,
      CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather,
      everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version
      numbers.
